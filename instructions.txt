The error you're getting is due to a connection problem with your WebSocket server. Here are a few steps to diagnose and resolve the problem.

### 1. **Check WebSocket server URL**
 The error indicates a connection problem with your WebSocket server. Check that the WebSocket server URL is correct.

   **Check your JavaScript code:**
 - The WebSocket URL must be set correctly (e.g. `ws://localhost:3000` or `wss://` for secure connections).
   - If you're using a local WebSocket server during development, the URL should be `ws://localhost:3000`. In production, you should use `wss://` if you're using HTTPS.

   Example:

 ```javascript
 const socket = new WebSocket( ws://localhost:3000'); // Or 'wss://...' in production
 ```

 **Action to be checked** :
   - Confirm that the WebSocket server is running and listening on the right port.
   - Check that the server is configured to be accessible from the client.

### 2. **Check the WebSocket connection in the browser**
 Use your browser's development tools to inspect the network and see exactly what's going on.

   - Open Development Tools** (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
   - Go to the **Network** tab and filter by **WebSocket** to see established connections.
   - If the connection fails, you should see a detailed error in this section.
